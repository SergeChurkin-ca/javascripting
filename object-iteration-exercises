        //2e. Put the control flow statement from 2d. into a function expression called checkIfOpen that takes one argument.

        //2f. Run the checkIfOpen function in the console. Check if the output matches what you would expect given that outdoorStore.open is currently false.

        // 2g. Change the value of outdoorStore.open and verify that checkIfOpen runs correctly.
