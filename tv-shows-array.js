// negative index means non existing array element


//7. I don't get HBO to watch Game of Thrones. Remove the first element in the array and log the array again.

//8. Your friends spoil the ending of LOST and you decide to skip it. Remove the last item in the array and log the array again.

//9. Let's make a separate list for our Netflix favourites. Remove "Stranger Things", "Daredevil", and "The Haunting of Hill House" from the tvShows array and populate them in a new array called netflixExclusives. Log this new array.

let netflixExclusives = tvShows.splice(8, 3);

//10. Now that we have cleaned up our original tvShows list, let's order it alphabetically and log out the array.

tvShows.sort();
//11. Change of plans - sort in REVERSE alphabetical order and log the array again!

//12. After watching Teen Wolf you become interested in actor Jason Bateman's work. Add "Arrested Development" and  "Ozark" to the array and log the array again.
tvShows.push('Arrested Development', 'Ozark');
console.log(tvShows)
    //13. Donald Glover releases a new track and you get inspired to watch "Atlanta" immediately. Add it to the start of the array and, you guessed it, log it out.

//14. Let's make the perfect binge watching weekend plan with the 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, and 10th show in the list. Make a new array called perfectWeekend WITHOUT removing them from the shows to watch array.

//15. Let's spice up our list. Log the perfect weekend array as a string with your favourite emoticon ⭐️ in-between each TV show.


for (let i = 0; i < tvShows.length; i++) {

//16. Awesome! To help with our organization lets combine the perfectWeekend and netflixExclusives arrays into a NEW array called bingeList. Log out your final array.



console.log(perfectWeekend);
